# Automatic_Liquid_Dispending_system
Machine system for the preparation of liquid recipes. Additionally is possible to make each mixture with individually programmed number of consecutive ingredients. 

This work was made for bachelor's thesis, which summary is below: 

The purpose of this work is to design and build a system for the preparation of liquid solutions. Where each mixture is made with an individually programmed number of consecutive ingredients. As part of the work, the technical concept of the liquid pouring module will be described. Additionally, it will be a specially developed application that allows the user to control the dosing. A prototype dispenser will be built and launched as part of this project. The assembly and testing process will be described in this paper. The project aims to show the process of creating various types of solutions in industry. Depending on the specific needs, the substances are mixed in different doses, so the presented machine will be able to combine 6 different liquids with each other and dose them in two modes
